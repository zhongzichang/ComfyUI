"""Walks the asset roots and turns what it finds into catalog rows: collecting
paths, building specs, seeding new content and records, then enriching them
with metadata and hashes. Each spec is seeded inside its own savepoint, so one
file whose row conflicts cannot discard the work done for the files around it.
Enrichment candidates use ordered ID pagination, so each row is attempted at
most once per pass while failed rows remain eligible for the next pass. A pause
can end a batch early, and the cursor holds at the last row the batch attempted,
so the rows it never reached are selected again when the scan resumes.
