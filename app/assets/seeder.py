"""Runs the filesystem scan on a background thread so startup never waits for it,
exposing pause, resume, cancel and progress to the API. A run seeds
newly-observed files first, then enriches records in batches, and settles any
pending hash-mode transition at the start of the enrich phase so a server that
receives no prompts still completes the switch. An enrichment pass ends when
its ordered candidate cursor is exhausted.
